# 📊 EDA & Feature Engineering - Laptop Price Predictor

This directory contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering process for the **Laptop Price Predictor** project.



## 📁 Contents

- Data Cleaning
- Handling Missing Values
- Outlier Removal
- Feature Transformation (e.g., converting resolution to PPI)
- Categorical Encoding (e.g., CPU, GPU, OS)
- Feature Selection



## 🛠️ What I Did

- ✅ Performed EDA using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`
- ✅ Visualized relationships between features and price
- ✅ Extracted and created meaningful features such as:
  - `ppi` from `Resolution` and `ScreenSize`
  - `CPU Brand` from `CPU`
- ✅ One-hot encoded categorical features
- ✅ Removed outliers to improve model accuracy


## 📦 Libraries Used
